# How to use Exploits Offsets
[FOR DUMB PEOPLE]
To get the offsets from thoose Addresses just open the calculator go to Programmer Option and put HEX option.
Then take one of thoose Addresses and paste in the calculator.
After write minus (-) the ImageBase of Apex that is: 7FF6B73E0000

Example [FOR DUMB DUMB PEOPLE]:
if I want to get the offset of "aEcharacterflav" that the Address is: 7FF6BF3748B3.
I will go to the Programmer Calculator and put the Apex ImageBase: 7FF6B73E0000
So for get the offset just do: 7FF6BF3748B3 - 7FF6B73E0000. So the result is: 7F9 48B3. To get the real offsets remove all the space from the result and add 0x before.
So the result offset is: 0x7F948B3
